  - "Closed at" is set to the current time and "Continuous Exposure" is set to `false` when "Monitoring Status" is changed to "Not Monitoring"
  - "Symptom Onset" is set to the time of the first symptomatic report (if such a report exists) if "Isolation" is set to `false`, or if "Symptom Onset" is deleted
  - Monitorees are added to the "Transferred In" and "Transferred Out" linelist as appropriate when jurisdiction changes
  - History items are created to track the side effects detailed above
- Improved validation error messaging: validation messages will more clearly indicate what value caused the validation error, and where that value is in the JSON document
