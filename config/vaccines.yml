# WARNING: Changing this configuration during the lifetime of a deployment may cause data in your application to become invalid.
#          Please read the section below carefully, which details safe and unsafe changes to this file.
#
# SAFE CHANGES: Adding entire vaccine groups, adding new products to existing vaccine groups, or adding new doses to existing
# vaccine products are safe changes. In general, additive changes are SAFE.
# 
# UNSAFE CHANGES: Removing entire vaccine groups, removing products from existing vaccine groups, changing product names within 
# existing vaccine groups, or removing doses from existing vaccine products are unsafe changes. 
# If it is absolutely necessary to make one or more of the unsafe changes detailed above, database migrations must be written 
# to update the vaccines, user_filters, and user_export_presets tables. 
# 
# Examples of migrations that accomplish these tasks are:
# (1) /db/migrate/20210824154651_update_vaccine_names.rb (change to vaccines table due to vaccine product name change)
# (2) /db/migrate/20210901192909_update_vaccine_product_names_to_match_cdc.rb (change to user_filters and user_export_presets tables due to vaccine product name change)
#
# Failure to migrate legacy data after an unsafe change to this file will leave "legacy" vaccines in an invalid state. While the 
# system can still function under these circumstances, vaccine records with invalid legacy data will not be modifiable without updating
# the invalid value(s) to valid ones.
