  <p>Dear <%= @user.email[/[^@]+/] %>,</p>

    You've been added to the <%= @user.jurisdiction.name %> jurisdiction. Your initial login credentials are:

    <b>Username:</b> <%= @user.email %>

    <b>Temporary password:</b> <%= @password %>
  </p>
  <p>
    This temporary password is only valid for 72 hours, so please log in to the Sara Alert application to change your password as soon as possible. If copying and pasting the temporary password results in an invalid login attempt, please manually type it instead.
