Sara Alert is an open source tool built to allow public health officials to monitor potentially exposed individuals (“monitorees”, e.g., contacts of cases or travelers from affected areas) over time for symptoms by enrolling them in the system. During enrollment, the potentially exposed individual indicates their preferred method for daily contact. The enrolled monitoree receives a daily reminder from Sara Alert to enter temperature and any symptoms. If any symptoms are reported, the public health official receives an alert in order to coordinate care. If the monitoree fails to report, the public health official can follow up after a pre-defined period. Public health officials have access to reports and aggregated data based on their level of access.

Sara Alert was built in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, but was designed to be customizable such that it can be deployed to support future outbreaks.

## Installing and Running

Sara Alert is a Ruby on Rails application that uses the MySQL database for data storage and Redis for message processing.

### Prerequisites

To work with the application, you will need to install some prerequisites:

* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)
* [Bundler](https://bundler.io/)
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
* [Redis](https://redis.io) (installation instructions [below](#redis))
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Development Installation

#### Application

Ensure that [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) is installed and initialized.

Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/SaraAlert/SaraAlert.git`

Run the following commands from the project's root directory to pull in both frontend and backend dependencies:

* `bundle install`
* `yarn install`

#### Database

Run the following commands from the root directory to initialize the database (note: make sure you have a MySQL database and Redis running):

* (optional for local development only, not for docker containers)
  ```
  mysql -u root -e "CREATE USER 'disease_trakker'@'localhost'; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'disease_trakker'@'localhost'; create database disease_trakker_test; create database disease_trakker_development;"
  ```
* `bundle exec rake db:drop db:create db:migrate db:setup`
* `bundle exec rake admin:import_or_update_jurisdictions`
* (optional) `bundle exec rake demo:setup demo:populate`
#### ActiveJob + Sidkiq + Redis + Whenever

ActiveJob will work with Sidekiq, Redis, and Whenever to manage the queueing and running of jobs (used to send emails, SMS, and other methods of notification).

##### Redis

Redis will need to be installed and running. To install Redis:

```bash
wget http://download.redis.io/redis-stable.tar.gz
tar xvzf redis-stable.tar.gz
cd redis-stable
make
```

To start Redis:

```
redis-server
```

##### Sidekiq

Sidekiq is the queueing system that ActiveJob interfaces with. Sidekiq should be installed when you ran `bundle install` in the application installation instructions. To start Sidekiq, and make it aware that it is responsible for the mailers queue, execute the following:

```
bundle exec sidekiq -q default -q mailers -q exports
```

##### Whenever

The [Whenever](https://github.com/javan/whenever) gem is used to help schedule jobs. This gem uses the contents of `config/schedule.rb` to generate a crontab file.

You must update your crontab for these jobs to run periodically (defined in `config/schedule.rb`). To do so run:

```
bundle exec whenever --update-crontab
```

##### Jobs
  
  The following jobs are configured to run continuously:
  * `ConsumeAssessmentsJob`
      - Should always be running in order to be ready to consume assessments at any time.
      - Handles consuming assessments from the assessment container into the enrollment container.
      - Subscribes to the Redis `reports` channel and consumes on every message in that channel.

  The following jobs are configured to run periodically (their run timing parameters are specified in `config/schedule.rb`):
  * `ClosePatientsJob`. 
      - Closes (stops active monitoring of) monitorees that meet duration/symptomatic conditions
  * `PurgeJob`
      - Purges eligible records
  * `SendPurgeWarningsJob`
      - Send warnings to users of upcoming PurgeJob
  * `CacheAnalyticsJob`
      - Caches analytics information for faster retrieval
  * `SendAssessmentsJob`
      - Send assessment reminders to monitorees
  * `PurgeJwtIdentifiersJob`
      - Purge expired JWT Identifiers that are saved and validated when clients request access to the API.

NOTE: In any production instance, these jobs should be handled outside of any of the containers (they should be scheduled and launched via crontab by the host).

#### Running

To run Sara Alert, execute: `bundle exec rails s`.

In a development environment, login with username/password credentials created with the [`demo:setup`](https://github.com/SaraAlert/SaraAlert/blob/master/lib/tasks/demo.rake) rake task
or create user accounts with the [`user:`](https://github.com/SaraAlert/SaraAlert/blob/master/lib/tasks/user.rake) rake tasks (some environment variables required).

### Installation (Docker)

#### Getting Started

Ensure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are installed.

This application includes several Dockerfiles and Docker Compose configurations. Let's go over each of them:

* `Dockerfile`: This Dockerfile is essentially the same as the `DevelopmentTest.Dockerfile` but provides support for developers that want to get a development and test environment up and running with a simple `docker build .`
* `DevelopmentTest.Dockerfile`: This Dockerfile is used in the project's Continuous Integration (CI) and allows developers to get started with the full split stack architecture as its the default used in the compose files. It contains the dependencies for running tests.
* `Production.Dockerfile`: This Dockerfile is built for production or staging deployments.
* `Nginx.Dockerfile`: This Dockerfile is built from `DevelopmentTest.Dockerfile` or `Production.Dockerfile` which contains all static assets (i.e. the `public/` folder).
* `docker-compose.yml`: This docker compose file sets up the numerous containers, networks, and volumes required for the split architecture.
* `docker-compose.prod.yml`: The only difference between this file and the normal one is the overwriting of the `DevelopmentTest` image tag with the `latest` tag.

##### Building

* Create a `certs/` directory in the root of the project

If you are building the image behined a corporate proxy:

* Place your company `.crt` file in it
* `export CERT_PATH=/path/to/crt_from_above.crt`

Building for staging requires the use of the `Production.Dockerfile` and `Nginx.Dockerfile`.

* `docker build -f Production.Dockerfile --tag sara-alert:latest --build-arg cert="$(cat $CERT_PATH)" .`
* `docker build -f Nginx.Dockerfile --tag sara-alert-nginx:latest --build-arg sara_alert_image=sara-alert:latest .`

##### Deploying Staging

Deploying a staging server is done with `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`, and the two images created in the previous section. Make sure the images are on the staging server or they can be pulled from a Docker registry to the staging server.

**Docker Networking**

The `docker-compose.yml` file sets up three networks which route traffic between the containers. The networks are:

* `dt-net-enrollment`: Hosts the applications/services used for enrolling and monitoring.
* `dt-net-assessment`: Hosts the application/services used by monitorees filling out assessments.
* `dt-net-bridge`: Facilitates communication between the two other networks.

This results in a 'split architecture' where multiple instances of the SaraAlert application are running. This approach attempts to reduces the amount of services that have access to the monitoree database.

A key portion of this is the use of the Nginx reverse proxy container. The configuration (located at `./nginx.conf`) will route traffic from 'untrusted' users submitting assessments to the `dt-net-assessment` application while, at the same time, enrollers and epidemiologists are routed to the enrollment database.

Below is a graphic depicting the services and applications present on each network:
![SaraAlertDockerNetworks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3009651/90296500-a7fc3200-de59-11ea-873b-f690c52509bc.png)

**Environment Variable Setup**

To set up Sara Alert in a staging configuration, generate two environment variable files which correspond with the networks described above:

* `.env-prod-assessment`
* `.env-prod-enrollment`

The content for these files can be based off of the `.env-prod-assessment-example` and `.env-prod-enrollment-example` files.

The `SECRET_KEY_BASE` and `MYSQL_PASSWORD` variables should be changed at the very least. These variables should also not be the same between both assessment and enrollment instances of the files. It is important to note that `SARA_ALERT_REPORT_MODE` should be set to `false` for the enrollment file and `true` for the assessment file.

**Twilio/Authy Environment Variables**
The following environment variables need to be set on the enrollment instances, which are the instances that will be dispatching the SMS/Voice assessments via Twilio and performing Two-Factor Authentication using Authy. These environment variables can be set in a `config/local_env.yml` file, or via a method provided by the deployment environment.
* `TWILLIO_API_ACCOUNT: <Account number for Twilio Account>`
* `TWILLIO_API_KEY: <API key for Twilio Account>`
* `TWILLIO_SENDING_NUMBER: <Phone number registered to Twilio Account for SMS/Voice>`
* `TWILLIO_STUDIO_FLOW: <Twilio Studio Flow ID for handling SMS/Voice Assessments>`
* `AUTHY_API_KEY: <API key for Authy project>`

**Container Dependencies**

Create a directory for the deployment. Move both docker compose files and both environment variable files from the previous section into this folder. Within this deployment directory, create a subdirectory called `tls` and place your `.key` and `.crt` files for the webserver inside. Name the files `puma.key` and `puma.crt`. Ensure the `.crt` and `.key` files within the `tls` directory are at least `0x004` permissions so they can be read inside the container.

The Nginx configuration is also staged within the same directory. You will need to move the `nginx.conf` provided in the root of this repository into `~/tls/nginx.conf`.

**Deployment**

Before any of the following commands, export the images you're working with. For the staging environment, the tag is assumed to be `latest`. Example for a locally built image (you will likely need to update this to point to your registry!): `export SARA_ALERT_IMAGE=sara-alert` and `export NGINX_IMAGE=sara-alert-nginx`.

* `/usr/local/bin/docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull`
* `/usr/local/bin/docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --remove-orphan`
* `/usr/local/bin/docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml run sara-alert-enrollment bin/bundle exec rake db:create`
* `/usr/local/bin/docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml run sara-alert-enrollment bin/bundle exec rake db:migrate`
* `/usr/local/bin/docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml run sara-alert-assessment bin/bundle exec rake db:create`
* `/usr/local/bin/docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml run sara-alert-assessment bin/bundle exec rake db:migrate`

**Post-deployment Setup**

Before any of the following commands, export the image you're working with. For the staging environment, the tag is assumed to be `latest`. Example for a locally built image (you will likely need to update this to point to your registry!): `export SARA_ALERT_IMAGE=sara-alert`

Load Jurisdictions:

* `/usr/local/bin/docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml run sara-alert-enrollment bin/bundle exec rake admin:import_or_update_jurisdictions`
* `/usr/local/bin/docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml run sara-alert-assessment bin/bundle exec rake admin:import_or_update_jurisdictions`

Note: If you need to make live-changes to the jurisdictions loaded on they system, you'll have to update `config/sara/jurisdictions.yml` on the sara-alert-assessment and sara-alert-enrollment containers. The changes made to each of the jurisdictions.yml files **NEED TO BE IDENTICAL**

Setup the demonstration accounts and population if desired:

* `/usr/local/bin/docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml -e DISABLE_DATABASE_ENVIRONMENT_CHECK=true run sara-alert-enrollment bin/bundle exec rake demo:setup`
* `/usr/local/bin/docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml -e DISABLE_DATABASE_ENVIRONMENT_CHECK=true run sara-alert-enrollment bin/bundle exec rake demo:populate`

The applications should be running on port 443 with Nginx proxying traffic between.
